## Lessons Learned

Learnt how to switch out an icon proper for a light/dark toggle, as well as learnt 
that there are multiple ways to force a default toggle on radio buttons. There 
were a few challenges along the way that a quick google search or GPT question 
pulled me back to my senses and made me just shake my head at how dumb I was. 
Overall, not a super complex project.
